# Walk through the /txt/slavic folder

# Walk through the subfolders of artists
# Each artist becomes their own column (alpha order)

# Each txt gets turned into a button 

# Any files in the root /txt/slavic folder are pushed to the last column

# Print out the final HTML result :) 


# TODO: See if the columns, if for instance one
# is like 10 items and another is 3 items, play nicely together.
# Otherwise, I may have to make some special maths for each one or a dumb way
# of counting how many songs each artist has to make the most balanced column
# arrangement. Or I may have to make it so that the sections are collapsed
# by default.
